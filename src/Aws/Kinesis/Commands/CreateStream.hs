-- Module: Aws.Kinesis.Commands.CreateStream
-- Copyright: Copyright Â© 2014 AlephCloud Systems, Inc.

-- Stability: experimental

--
-- This operation adds a new Amazon Kinesis stream to your AWS account. A
-- stream captures and transports data records that are continuously emitted
-- from different data sources or producers. Scale-out within an Amazon Kinesis
-- stream is explicitly supported by means of shards, which are uniquely
-- identified groups of data records in an Amazon Kinesis stream.
--
-- You specify and control the number of shards that a stream is composed of.
-- Each open shard can support up to 5 read transactions per second, up to a
-- maximum total of 2 MB of data read per second. Each shard can support up to
-- 1000 write transactions per second, up to a maximum total of 1 MB data
-- written per second. You can add shards to a stream if the amount of data
-- input increases and you can remove shards if the amount of data input
-- decreases.
--
-- The stream name identifies the stream. The name is scoped to the AWS account
-- used by the application. It is also scoped by region. That is, two streams
-- in two different accounts can have the same name, and two streams in the
-- same account, but in two different regions, can have the same name.
--
-- CreateStream is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a CreateStream
-- request, Amazon Kinesis immediately returns and sets the stream status to
-- CREATING. After the stream is created, Amazon Kinesis sets the stream status
-- to ACTIVE. You should perform read and write operations only on an ACTIVE
-- stream.
--
-- You receive a LimitExceededException when making a CreateStream request if
-- you try to do one of the following:
--
-- Have more than five streams in the CREATING state at any point in time.
-- Create more shards than are authorized for your account. Note: The default
-- limit for an AWS account is 10 shards per stream. If you need to create a
-- stream with more than 10 shards, contact AWS Support to increase the limit
-- on your account.
--
-- You can use the DescribeStream operation to check the stream status, which
-- is returned in StreamStatus.
--
-- CreateStream has a limit of 5 transactions per second per account.
